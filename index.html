                 <p style="color:#444444; font-size:24px;"> Motion and change capture time as a distance traveled. We use sundial, pendulum, watch hand to anthropomorphize time into a tangible measurement, but our modern perception of time is not universal. It has developed towards greater standardization and precision to create congruity While a clock shows time as a cycle, a count represents the progression of time. These digital time keepers compare different visualizations of time. The first shows time as colors moving in a cycle. The second counts the uniqueness of each moment in a progression.

            <p style="color:#444444; font-size:24px;">This timepiece cycles every day, the color of each arc set by the horizon line. It gradients from first to last light. This is a traditional notion of time as cyclical. A full circle reapeats daily in an seemingly infinite loop. As days lengthen into summer or shorten into winter the diameter responds. Like Marey's chronophotgraphy, it shows a relative cycle broken up into its parts. The movement of the cylce conveys the passing of time.

            <p style="color:#444444; font-size:24px;">The timepiece captures a chronology of unique displays moving towards an end. At four frames per second it will take approximately 8 years to iterate through all the  possible positions of the green and red squares on the grid. Each pattern will only appear once. Every visual moment of the gird is unique. Timepiece quickly can reach the limit of a human lifetime. One moment may not repeat for a life time. This understanding of the future sparks value in observing it now. It follows that the Japanese idiom Ichi-go ichi-e can describe it: the notion that conditions only happen once and never repeat.
