                 <p style="color:#444444; font-size:24px;"> Motion and change capture time as a distance traveled. We use sundial, pendulum, watch hand to anthropomorphize time into a tangible measurement, but our modern perception of time is not universal. It has developed towards greater standardization and precision to create congruity. Like any system design the framing informs the visual representation. While a clock affords a cycles, a count represents the progression. These digital time keepers compare these two approached first shows time as colors moving in a cycle and the second counts the uniqueness of each moment in a progression.

            <p style="color:#444444; font-size:24px;">This timepiece cycles every day, the color of each arc set by the horizon line. It gradients from first to last light.  A full circle marks the progress of daylight. As days lengthen into summer or shorten into winter the diameter responds. Like Marey's chronophotgraphy, it shows a relative trajectory of motion: each shade relative to the prior and the next.

            <p style="color:#444444; font-size:24px;">The timepiece captures a chronology of unique displays moving towards an end. At four frames per second it will take approximately 8 years to iterate through all the  possible positions of the green and red squares on the grid. Each pattern will only appear once. Every visual moment of the gird is unique. Timepiece quickly can reach the limit of a human lifetime. One moment may not repeat for a life time. This understanding of the future sparks value in observing it now. It follows that the Japanese idiom Ichi-go ichi-e can describe it: the notion that conditions only happen once and never repeat.
