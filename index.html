    <h1>Visual Time </h1>
    <p>Elijah Ezralow -- Mar 21 -- Demo Version<br> Introduction </p>
	<p>Time is experienced on a visual substrate. Change in the physical world defines time, which is otherwise a metaphysical concept. A look at the ebbing moon or lengthening daylight hours, and we see that time passes in a spatial way. Motion is an embodiment of time. The gradual approach of winter or the sprint of a runner doesnâ€™t just express a physical distance traveled but a temporal one as well. In this context, motion becomes a catalyst in which we can see time through our senses. Visualizing movement personifies time so that we can feel it in our lives. This is the closest we can get to time within our bounds of perception.

	 </p>
	  
	<p>I have created two timepieces to show ways in which we as humans experience time through change and motion. They are constructed to fit within a schema of different visualizations of time we experience in art and culture. The timepieces are meant to juxtapose each other; The first timekeeper focuses on cycles and rhythm, the second on uniqueness and progression. The objective is to better understand different ways that time can be perceived. Each timepiece is inspired by a number of ways to look at time in visual arts.

	<p> This timepiece takes place over a day. The cycle passes at a timescale that is long enough to be perceivable and short enough to be comprehended by humans. The timepiece captures the motion of the sky over the duration of its circumference. A rhythm like this is most natural to our sense of time. The circle is divided into arcs corresponding to each part of the day. Each arc color is set by a sky in a certain location at that time. The first arc of the circle marks the first light, and the last arc marks the last light of that day. A full circle marks the progress of light throughout the day. The rhythm is not just a result of cycles. The graduation of moment to moment in a relative way creates a more specific rhythm. Like Marey's overlayed chronophotography, it shows a trajectory of causation. We see this gradual progression through moments in the day sky as light gets stronger to noon and then dissipates as the sunsets. In this timepiece, relative motion is shown in the depth of each arc, whose width is proportional to its brightness. We can see a vector mapped out in the circle of light throughout the day. Each sky color is relational to the moments before and indicative of the next. The piece does not wildly oscillate but stays within a charted path.

	The second piece contrasts the first. It shows a series of unique moments moving towards an end. At its current rate, it will take approximately eight years to iterate through all the possible positions of the green and red squares on the grid. Each pattern will only appear once in this time frame so that frozen on any moment the gird is unique. It embodies the Japanese idiom Ichi-go ichi-e or the notion that conditions only happen once and never repeat. Contrary to cycles, uniqueness puts added value on each individual moment. The notion of the uniqueness of moments supports the evolutionary theory and a progress narrative that developed from enlightenment. If each moment is unique, it is possible for humans to try and shape them differently.

	Progress in this timepiece is controlled algorithmically by increasing binary numbers. We see this represented as a grid of colored squares. These squares start as a pink-red gradient. Throughout the artwork, blue-green squares replace the red squares until the whole grid transitions. In the process the gird iterates through all the possible permutations of the squares. At the end the screen will become a full blue to turquoise gradient fully replacing the red squares. At the final moment, the timepiece will have reached an entirely new condition; the green will have been replaced. The piece has moved from start to finish, beginning to end, old too new. Although abstract, it has the formulaic change seen when pushing the past away to create the modern. The increasing green on screen defines an era different from that of the red.

	This timepiece is finite in its breakdown of moments. As Zeno's paradox posits, a continuous world is impossible to move through. It suggests there must be a limit to divisibility to create motion. We rely on finite space and time to move forwards. Without these finite divisions, one couldn't move because there would be seemingly nothing to move away from. In this timepiece, there is this divisibility inherent in the code.
	</p>
<p>
	The duration in which the timepiece takes is intentionally impractical. We are seemingly connected to a distant future through the present visualization. The degree to which it will take to complete is dependent on its resolution. Each square added to the screen exponentially increases the possible configurations to create and the duration of the piece. Quickly the timepiece can reach the limit of a human lifetime. Looking at one moment now, we realize that it will never repeat. It is this understanding of the length of the timepiece and the continual forward momentum into that future moment that seems to spark value in observing its ticking.
