    <h1>Visual Time </h1>
    <p>Elijah Ezralow -- Mar 21 -- Demo Version<br> Introduction </p>
	<p>
Time is experienced on a visual substrate. Visual change in the physical world makes time apparent rather than abstract. A look at the ebbing moon or lengthening daylight hours, and we see time through its spatial representation. Motion is this embodiment of time as the physical world moves. In this context, motion becomes a catalyst in which we can see time. Thes visualizations let us personify time in a more tangible way. I have created two timepieces to show how we as humans experience time through change and motion. They are constructed around a schema of different types of visualizations of time. The timepieces are meant to juxtapose each other; The first focuses on cycles and rhythm, the second on uniqueness and progression. The objective is to better understand different ways that time can be perceived visually. Each timepiece is inspired by a number of ways to look at time in visual art.    	</p>

	This timepiece is meant functionally to tell time from the colors of the sky. The piece is influenced by the motif of a circular clock which represents a day's cycle. Here, however, we measure only the cycle of the sun in order to focus on qualities of light, the most fundamental source of time. The timepiece brings us back to a classical way of using the sun and sundials as a visual means of keeping time. Like a sundial, the circle is divided into arcs corresponding to parts of the day. Each arc is set by the color of the sky in a certain location at that time. The first arc of the circle marks the first light, and the last arc marks the last light. Sky colors lend themself to showing time through repetition.

The graduation of color to color on the timepiece in a relative way creates a rhythm. The piece does not wildly oscillate but stays within a charted path. Like Marey's overlayed chronophotography, it shows a trajectory of causation. In this piece, each arc of color has a thickness proportional to its lightness, with the thinnest arc being the lightest color of that day. In this way each sky color is relational to the moments before and indicative of the next, creating a path to follow. We see this gradual progression through moments in the day. This timepiece personifies time as a vector of movment both through the sky and through colors or brightnes of light.

The second piece contrasts the first. It shows a series of unique moments moving towards an end. At its current rate, it will take approximately eight years to iterate through all the possible positions of the green and red squares on this grid. Each pattern will only appear once in this time frame so that frozen at any moment the gird is unique. It embodies the Japanese idiom Ichi-go ichi-e or the notion that conditions only happen once and never repeat. Contrary to cycles, uniqueness puts added value on each individual moment. The notion of the uniqueness of moments supports the evolutionary theory and a progress narrative that developed from enlightenment. If each moment is unique, it is possible for humans to try and shape them differently.

Progress in this timepiece is controlled algorithmically by increasing binary numbers and translating them. We see this represented as a grid of colored squares. These squares start as a pink-red gradient. Throughout the artwork, blue-green squares replace the red squares until the whole grid transitions. In the process, the grid iterates through all the possible permutations of the squares. At the end, the screen will become a full blue to turquoise gradient fully replacing the red squares. At the final moment, the timepiece will have reached an entirely new condition; the green will have been replaced. The piece has moved from start to finish, beginning to end, old too new. 	</p>
<p>
This timepiece is finite in its breakdown of moments. As Zeno's paradox posits, a continuous world is impossible to move through. It suggests there must be a limit of divisibility to create motion. We rely on finite space and time to move forwards. Without these finite divisions, one couldn't move because there would be seemingly nothing to move away from. In this timepiece, there is this divisibility inherent in the code. Each moment distances itself from the present as it becomes new. Although abstract, it has the formulaic change seen when pushing the past away to create the modern. The increasing green on-screen defines an era different from that of the red.

The duration in which the timepiece takes is intentionally impractical. We are seemingly connected to a distant future through the present visualization. The degree to which it will take to complete is dependent on its resolution. Each square added to the screen exponentially increases the possible configurations to create and the duration of the piece. Quickly the timepiece can reach the limit of a human lifetime. Looking at one moment now, we realize that it will never repeat. It is this understanding of the length of the timepiece and the continual forward momentum into that future moment that seems to spark value in observing its ticking.
