         Visual Time
      </h1>
      
      <p>
  Time is experienced on a visual substrate. Change in the physical world defines time, which is otherwise a metaphysical concept. A look at the ebbing moon or lengthening daylight hours, and we see that time passes in a spatial way. Motion is an embodiment of time. The gradual approach of winter or the sprint of a runner doesn’t just express a physical distance traveled but a temporal one as well. In this context, motion becomes a catalyst in which we can see time through our senses. Visualizing movement personifies time so that we can feel it in our lives. This is the closest we can get to time within our bounds of perception.
I have created two timepieces to show ways in which we as humans experience time through change and motion. They are constructed to fit within a schema of different visualizations of time we experience in art and culture. The timepieces are meant to juxtapose each other; The first timekeeper focuses on cycles and rhythm, the second on uniqueness and progression. The objective is to better understand different ways that time can be perceived. Each timepiece is inspired by a number of ways to look at time in visual arts.
