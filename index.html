    <h1>Visulazing Time </h1>
    <p>Elijah Ezralow -- Mar 21</p>
    <p> Introduction </p>
	<p>Time is experienced on a visual substrate. Change in the physical world defines time, which is otherwise a metaphysical concept. A look at the ebbing moon or lengthening daylight hours, and we see that time passes in a spatial way. Motion is an embodiment of time. The gradual approach of winter or the sprint of a runner doesnâ€™t just express a physical distance traveled but a temporal one as well. In this context, motion becomes a catalyst in which we can see time through our senses. Visualizing movement personifies time so that we can feel it in our lives. This is the closest we can get to time within our bounds of perception.

	 </p>
	  
	<p>I have created two timepieces to show ways in which we as humans experience time through change and motion. They are constructed to fit within a schema of different visualizations of time we experience in art and culture. The timepieces are meant to juxtapose each other; The first timekeeper focuses on cycles and rhythm, the second on uniqueness and progression. The objective is to better understand different ways that time can be perceived. Each timepiece is inspired by a number of ways to look at time in visual arts.

	<p> This timepiece takes place over a day. The cycle passes at a timescale that is long enough to be perceivable and short enough to be comprehended by humans. The timepiece captures the motion of the sky over the duration of its circumference. A rhythm like this is most natural to our sense of time. The circle is divided into arcs corresponding to each part of the day. Each arc color is set by a sky in a certain location at that time. The first arc of the circle marks the first light, and the last arc marks the last light of that day. A full circle marks the progress of light throughout the day. The rhythm is not just a result of cycles. The graduation of moment to moment in a relative way creates a more specific rhythm. Like Marey's overlayed chronophotography, it shows a trajectory of causation. We see this gradual progression through moments in the day sky as light gets stronger to noon and then dissipates as the sunsets. In this timepiece, relative motion is shown in the depth of each arc, whose width is proportional to its brightness. We can see a vector mapped out in the circle of light throughout the day. Each sky color is relational to the moments before and indicative of the next. The piece does not wildly oscillate but stays within a charted path.
